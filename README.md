# Finite State Machine (FSM)

## Description
This project implements a simple Finite State Machine (FSM) in Python. The FSM can be used to simulate different states and transitions based on given inputs. It includes functionalities to initialize the FSM, transition between states, reset to the start state, check for accepting states, and run the FSM on a sequence of inputs.

## Features
- Initialize the FSM with a start state, state transitions, and accepting states
- Transition to a new state based on one input
- Reset the FSM to the start state
- Check if the FSM is in an accepting state
- Run the FSM on a sequence of inputs

## Installation
To use the FSM class, you can simply clone this repository and import the FSM class into your project.
